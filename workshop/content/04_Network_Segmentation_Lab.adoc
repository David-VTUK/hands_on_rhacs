== Introduction to {labname}

Network Segmentation works by controlling how traffic flows among the parts.
You may choose to stop the traffic in one part from reaching another, or limit the flow by traffic type, source, destination, and many other criteria.
How you decide to segment your network is called a _segmentation_ policy.

Segmentation improves cybersecurity by limiting how far an attack can spread.
For example, segmentation keeps a malware outbreak in one section from affecting systems in another.

Using Kubernetes network policies in OpenShift^(R)^, you can restrict open network paths for isolation and to prevent lateral movement by attackers.

=== Kubernetes Network Policies

A Kubernetes network policy is a specification of how groups of pods are allowed to communicate with each other and with other network endpoints.
These network policies are configured as YAML files.
However, it is often hard to identify, just by looking at these files alone, whether the applied network policies achieve the desired network topology.
Red Hat^(R)^ Advanced Cluster Security for Kubernetes (RHACS) gathers the defined network policies from your orchestrator and provides functionality to make these policies easier to use.

.Goals

* Examine namespace and deployment details
* Switch from the active view to the allowed connections view
* Use the network policy simulator
* Fix PCI compliance in the microservices demo application

== Explore Network Graph

=== Navigate to Network Graph

The network graph combines a flow diagram, a firewall diagram, and a firewall rule builder in one view.

.Procedure
. From the left, navigate to the *Network Graph* tab:
+
image::rhacs_network_graph.png[RHACS Network Graph]
+
* In the upper left, there is a cluster menu with `production` selected.
* You can easily navigate between any of the clusters connected to RHACS.
* The default view, *Active*, shows you actual traffic for the past hour between the deployments in the namespaces.
* You can change the time frame (in the upper right menu) and the legend (at the bottom left).

=== Compare Flow Views

The *Flows* selection provides three perspectives on network traffic--active, allowed, and all:

* *Active*: Provides a flow diagram of actual network activity over the past timeframe.

* *Allowed*: Similar to a firewall diagram, shows the rules in place.

* *All*: Allows you to compare and contrast how the rules are implemented in real time.

The *Allowed* setting helps you to quickly see the difference between a configuration with selected firewall rules enforced and a wide-open view as shown with the *All* selection.

.Procedure
. In the *Flows* box at upper left, click *Allowed*.
* The red dots indicate an unrestricted deployment (an open network), which is unfortunately the default in OpenShift.
* The dashed lines indicate a namespace with no restrictions on ingress or egress.
Again, this is a default that does not promote good security and conflicts with best practices required under several compliance standards.

=== Examine Namespace and Deployment Details

In the complete network graph, deployment names are not visible.
Details of their flows and baselines are available when you zoom in on them.
You can also view some details of network flows by hovering over the connecting lines.

.Procedure
. Scroll or pinch to zoom in on the `payments` namespace.
As you zoom in, the namespace boxes show the individual deployment names.
. Click the dot representing the `visa-processor` deployment.
* Selecting a deployment brings up details of the types of traffic observed, including source or destination and ports:
+
image::rhacs_deployment_flows.png[RHACS Deployment Details]
+
NOTE: Your *Anomalous Flows* list might be different
+
* Here you can create a baseline for the active flows and trigger alerts for anomalous flows.
* You can also switch to the *Network Policies* tab to investigate and download them.
* The *Details* tab has general information about the deployment.
. Click away from the box to close it and see the whole network graph.

== Use Network Policy Simulator

OpenShift defaults to no egress or ingress restrictions on namespaces.
This may be useful for proof of concepts, but it conflicts with best practices required under several compliance standards.
The network policy simulator is designed to help solve this problem quickly and accurately by using the history of observed traffic to build firewall rules.

.Procedure
. At the top right, click *Network Policy Simulator*.
. Click *Generate and simulate network policies*:
+

The firewall rules you are generating are not proprietary rules, but OpenShift-native NetworkPolicy objects.
This feature, more than any other, illustrates the philosophy that RHACS represents: security through platform-native features with fixes supplied as configuration for OpenShift.

By implementing stronger security through declarative statements, this avoids the _anti-pattern_ of having configuration rules in a separate system. This code becomes part of your application, ensuring the consistency of a _single source of truth_ for your codebase.
This approach also reduces operational risk because there is no proprietary firewall in your cluster or in your pods that could fail, causing an application outage.

RHACS leverages the firewall that is already in your OpenShift cluster.
Throughout the product you see this approach: _fix it in the code_; _leverage the platform_. In this lab, you explore those policies through examples of policy violations.

== Fix PCI Compliance in Microservices Demo Application

[quote, PCI-DSS website, https://www.pcisecuritystandards.org]
The best way to maximize security of cardholder data is to continuously monitor and enforce the use of controls specified in the PCI Data Security Standard.

RHACS continuously monitors and enforces policies and is aware of PCI-DSS compliance standards.

In this section, you bring the `microservices-demo` application closer to compliance with RHACS.

.Procedure
. Zoom in to the `microservices-demo` namespace, select one of the deployments, and examine the deployment details (on the right side):
+
image::rhacs_microservices_demo_namespace.png[Network graph for microservices-demo namespace]
+
NOTE: These deployment dots are [red]#red# because they have no Network Policies associated with them yet.

. From the left, navigate to the *Compliance* page.
. In the upper right, click *SCAN ENVIRONMENT*:
+
image::rhacs_microservices_compliance.png[Overall environment compliance]

. On the top of the *Compliance* page, click *Namespaces* to see a report of compliance scores by namespace.
. At the top, use the filter bar to restrict the view to the `Namespace: microservices-demo`.

. Examine the results to see that the `microservices-demo` namespace has approximately 64% compliance for PCI, but with some significant gaps, especially on Control section 1, which addresses network isolation:
+
image::rhacs_microservices_pci_1.png[Compliance for Online Boutique shop microservices demo before network policy changes]

. After you note the current compliance level, return to the *Network Graph* page.
+
Next, you generate some network policies to improve the compliance score on the PCI benchmark.

. At the top, use the filter bar to narrow the view to `Namespace: microservices-demo`.
+
The network graph changes focus to only the `microservices-demo` namespace.

. Click *Network Policy Simulator* and then *Generate and simulate network policies*:
+
image::rhacs_microservices_netpol.png[Generated Kubernetes Network Policies for Online Boutique]

. Click *Apply Network Policies*.
. Refresh and expect to see that the deployments in the `microservices-demo` namespace are [blue]#blue#, indicating that they have network policies applied.
+
The PCI compliance score increases for the `microservices-demo` namespace, because those network policies meet the requirements for isolation of retail applications that handle cardholder data.

. Navigate back to *Compliance* and click *Scan Environment*.
+
After the compliance scan completes, you can see that the PCI score has increased.
+
. Enter `Namespace: microservices-demo` into the filter bar to restrict the view to the `microservices-demo` namespace.
. Examine the results to see that the `microservices-demo` namespace has an approximately 79% compliance for PCI:

== Summary

RHACS makes it easy to analyze the network security of your OpenShift clusters and helps you take advantage of OpenShift's built-in firewall protections.

To support network policy enforcement, you used Red Hat Advanced Cluster Security for Kubernetes to do the following:

* Examine the network and individual deployments in the network graph
* Create network policies in the network policy simulator
* Apply network policies with the generator
* Bring deployments closer to PCI DSS compliance by implementing appropriate network policies

In the next lab, you take a look at what those policies look like, with examples of policy violations.
