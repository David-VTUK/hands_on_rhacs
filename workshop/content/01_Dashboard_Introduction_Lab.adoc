= Navigating the RHACS Console
In this section, you familiarize yourself with the RHACS portal, including its tabs, search capabilities and dashboard functionality.

Head to the RHACS web console from the course introduction lab. If you do not have access, please repeat the steps in the first lab titled "Access the RHACS Console."

== The 4 Main Dashboard Sections
The RHACS dashboard has four main sections:

[start=1]
. Top Bar
. Global search
. Navigation menu
. Dashboard

image::images/01-dashboard-00.png[RHACS dashboard labelled]

=== Top Bar

The top bar contains the following functionality 
* Global Search
* Command-line tools
* Cluster Health
* Documentation
* API Reference
* Enable Dark/Light Mode
* Logged-in user account

[NOTE]
The top bar is available in EVERY tab and displayed when accessing the RHACS console.

=== Global Search

image::images/01-dashboard-01.png[RHACS global search]

==== Searching and filtering

The ability to instantly find resources is essential to safeguard your cluster. Utilize the RHACS search feature to find relevant resources faster. 

For example, you can use it to find deployments exposed to a newly published CVE or all deployments with external network exposure.

.Search syntax
A search query consists of two parts:

* An attribute that identifies the resource type you want to search for.
* A search term that finds the matching resource.

*For example,* to find all violations in the visa-processor deployment, the search query is Deployment:visa-processor. In this search query, Deployment is the attribute, and visa-processor is the search term.

==== Using local page filtering
You can use local page filtering from within all views in the RHACS portal. Local page filtering works similarly to the global search, but only relevant attributes are available. You can select the search bar to show all available attributes for a specific view.

==== Common search queries
Here are some common search queries you can run with Red Hat Advanced Cluster Security for Kubernetes.

[start=1]
. Finding deployments that are affected by a specific CVE

[cols="2,2"]  
|=== 
|*Query*
|*Example*
|CVE:<CVE_number>
|CVE:CVE-2018-11776
|===

[start=2]
. Finding privileged running deployments

[cols="2,2"]
|=== 
|*Query*
|*Example*
|Privileged:<true_or_false>
|Privileged:true
|===

[start=3]
. Finding deployments that have external network exposure

[cols="2,2"]
|=== 
|*Query*
|*Example*
|Exposure Level:<level>
|Exposure Level:External
|===

[NOTE]
There are plenty more local and global search examples in the link:https://docs.openshift.com/acs/operating/search-filter.html[RHACS documentation] 

=== Navigation Menu

image::images/01-dashboard-03.png[RHACS navigation]

The left-hand navigation menu provides access to each of the security use cases, as well as product configuration to integrate RHACS with your existing tooling.
The navigation menu has the following items:

* *Dashboard*: Summary view of your environment
* *Network Graph*: Configured and actual network flows and the creation of Network Policies to implement network segmentation
* *Violations*: Events that do not match the defined security policies
* *Compliance*: Several industry and regulatory security standards, such as PCI DSS
* *Vulnerability Management*: Information about known vulnerabilities affecting your environment, including deployed workloads and infrastructure, risk acceptance and reporting.
* *Configuration Management*: Identification of potential misconfigurations that can lead to security issues
* *Risk*: Risks affecting your environment, such as suspicious executions
* *Platform Configuration*: RHACS configuration, policy management and integration details, including;
** *Clusters*
** *Policy Management*
** *Integrations*
** *Access Control*
** *System Configuration*
** *System Health*

This course follows the pattern of the major use cases, but in the order of most common to least common, starting with the *Main Dashboard* and moving to the *Vulnerability Management* tab next.

=== Dashboard

The Red Hat Advanced Cluster Security for Kubernetes (RHACS) Dashboard provides quick access to the data you need. It contains additional navigation shortcuts and actionable widgets that are easy to filter and customize so that you can focus on the data that matters most to you. You can view information about levels of risk in your environment, compliance status, policy violations, and common vulnerabilities and exposures (CVEs) in images.

[NOTE]
When you open the RHACS portal for the first time, the Dashboard might be empty. After you deploy Sensor in at least one cluster, the Dashboard reflects the status of your environment.

== Navigating the Main Dashboard

The main Dashboard is your place to look at the vulnerabilities, risk, compliance, and policy violations across your clusters and namespaces. This section addresses all of the functionality in the main Dashboard to help you navigate it more effectively in the future.

Let's start by breaking the Dashboard down into sections.

=== The Three Dashboard Sections

The three core dashboard components are as follows
[start=1]
. The Status Bar
. The Dashboard Filter
. The Actionable Widgets

image::images/01-dashboard-05.png[RHACS dashboard numbered]

=== The Status Bar

The Status Bar provides at-a-glance numerical counters for critical resources. The counters reflect what is visible with your current access scope, defined by the roles associated with your user profile. These counters are clickable, providing fast access to the desired list view pages as follows:

[cols="1,2"]
|===
|*Counter*|*Destination*
|Clusters|Platform Configuration → Clusters
|Nodes|Configuration Management → Application & Infrastructure → Nodes
|Violations|Violations main menu
|Deployments|Configuration Management → Application & Infrastructure → Deployments
|Images|Vulnerability Management → Dashboard → Images
|Secrets|Configuration Management → Application & Infrastructure → Secrets
|===
=== The Dashboard Filter
The Dashboard includes a top-level filter that applies simultaneously to all widgets. You can select clusters and one or more namespaces within selected clusters. *When no clusters or namespaces are selected, the view automatically switches to All*. Any change to the filter is immediately reflected by all widgets, limiting the data they present to the selected scope. 

[NOTE]
The Dashboard filter does not affect the Status Bar.

=== Actionable widgets
The following sections describe the actionable widgets available in the Dashboard. There are six in total, and they cannot be set for future use. 

==== Policy violations by severity

image::images/01-widget-00.png[policy violations]

This widget shows the distribution of violations across severity levels for the Dashboard-filtered scope. Clicking a severity level in the chart takes you to the Violations page, filtered for that severity and scope. It also lists the three most recent violations of a Critical level policy within the scope you defined in the Dashboard filter. Clicking a specific violation takes you directly to the Violations detail page for that violation.

==== Images at most risk

image::images/01-widget-01.png[Images at most risk]

This widget lists the top six vulnerable images within the Dashboard-filtered scope, sorted by their computed risk priority and the number of critical and important CVEs they contain. Click on an image name directly on the Image Findings page under Vulnerability Management. Use the Options menu to focus on fixable CVEs or further focus on active images.

When clusters or namespaces have been selected in the Dashboard filter, the data displayed is already filtered to active images or images used by deployments within the filtered scope.

==== Deployments at most risk

image::images/01-widget-02.png[deployments at most risk]

This widget provides information about the top deployments at risk in your environment. It displays additional information, such as the resource location (cluster and namespace) and the risk priority score. Additionally, you can click on a deployment to view risk information about the Deployment; for example, its policy violations and vulnerabilities.

==== Aging images

image::images/01-widget-03.png[Aging images]

Older images present a higher security risk because they can contain vulnerabilities that have already been addressed. If older images are active, they can expose deployments to exploits. This widget can quickly assess your security posture and identify offending images. You can use the default ranges or customize the age intervals with your values. You can view both inactive and active images or use the Dashboard filter to focus on a particular area for active images. You can then click on an age group in this widget to view only those images in the Vulnerability Management → Images page.

==== Policy violations by category

image::images/01-widget-04.png[Policy violations]

This widget can help you gain insights into your organization's challenges in complying with security policies by analyzing which types of policies are violated more than others. The widget shows the five policy categories of highest interest. Explore the Options menu for different ways to slice the data. You can filter the data to focus exclusively on deployment or runtime violations.

You can also change the sorting mode. By default, the data is sorted by the number of violations within the highest severity first. Therefore, all categories with critical policies will appear before those without. The other sorting mode considers the total number of violations regardless of severity. Because some categories contain no necessary policies (for example, "Docker CIS"), the two sorting modes can provide significantly different views, offering additional insight.

Click on a severity level at the bottom of the Graph to include or exclude that level from the data. Selecting different severity levels can result in another top-five selection or ranking order. Data is filtered to the chosen scope by the Dashboard filter.

==== compliance by standard
image::images/01-widget-05.png[Compliance ]
You can use the compliance by the standard widget with the Dashboard filter to focus on areas that matter most to you. Depending on sort order, the widget lists the top or bottom six compliance benchmarks. Select Options to sort by the coverage percentage. Click on one of the benchmark labels or graphs to go directly to the Compliance Controls page, filtered by the Dashboard scope and the selected benchmark.

[NOTE] You must perform a compliance scan for any information to show up in the widget. Clicking the widget will take you to the compliance dashboard, where you can scan the environment.

== Summary

Congratulations!

You should now be able to navigate the main RHACS dashboard effectively. Let's take a look at more use cases in the next section.

Please continue to the Vulnerability Management lab.
