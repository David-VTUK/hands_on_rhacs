== Introduction to Course Setup and Product Overview

This course offers you hands-on experience working with the essential use cases of Red Hat^(R)^ Advanced Cluster Security for Kubernetes (RHACS) and the spotlight on new features in new releases.

In this lab, you learn about the environment deployed for running RHACS, verify that you can access the various components of RHACS, and review its major components.

.Goals
* Understand, provision, and access the environment
* Understand RHACS architecture
* Understand the RHACS console
* Test practical use cases and features in RHACS

== Lab Components

In this course, you will utilize the following:

* RHACS portal
* OpenShift Container Platform web console
* Command line

To complete all of the lab tasks.

=== Environment Architecture 

This course comprises a single-node OpenShift Container Platform (OCP) cluster, an OpenShift control plane and a worker node in one large virtual machine (VM). A Linux VM to enable connection to the Lab components is called a Linux^(R)^ student VM. There the lab is comprised of the following components.

1. Red Hat OpenShift^(R)^ Container Platform 4.9 with RHACS installed on a single virtual machine (VM)
2. A Linux^(R)^ student VM (hostname `bastion`) for command line tasks

=== Red Hat OpenShift^(R)^ Container Platform Components

To illustrate that the installation is running Single Node OpenShift. Here is the output of an example `oc get nodes` command that shows the `master` node is also a `worker` node:

*Sample input*
[source,bash]
----
oc get nodes
----
*Sample output*
[source,bash]
----
NAME                                         STATUS   ROLES           AGE   VERSION
ip-10-0-143-248.us-east-2.compute.internal   Ready    master,worker   92m   v1.22.3+ffbb954
----

[NOTE] 
This command can be run later once the connections are set up.

== Managing the Lab Environment

=== Provisioning the Lab Environment
It is assumed that the lab environment has been provisioned by you already.

The lab environment is cloud-based, so you can access it online from anywhere. Red Hat has made efforts to provide a lab environment that is sufficiently powered to meet the lab's needs. Feel free to use this environment for your experiments with Red Hat Advanced Cluster Security.

NOTE: The environment automatically shuts down after approximately four hours of runtime, so try to finish this course in one sitting.
If necessary, extend the runtime of your environment through the link:https://demo.redhat.com/[Red Hat Demo Platform^].

Read the email carefully and specifically note the following:

* The URL for the RHACS portal and the necessary credentials
* The URL for the OpenShift Container Platform web console and the necessary credentials
* The hostname for your student VM environment and instructions for connecting to it via SSH

[NOTE]
This information will be available in the services tab at link:https://demo.redhat.com/[demo.redhat.com^]. Or in the lab provisioning email.

=== Restarting the Lab Environment After Shutdown

To conserve resources, the lab environment shuts down automatically after four hours.
This section provides the steps to restart it.

.Procedure
. Go to the link:https://demo.redhat.com/[demo.redhat.com^] using your login credentials.
. Navigate to *Services* on the left side
. Locate your lab environment in the list of your services
. On the right-hand side, under the Actions column, you will find the start button, use it.

After a few minutes, expect to receive an email letting you know that the Hands-On with Red Hat Advanced Cluster Security environment has been started.

[NOTE]
After the lab has been restarted, you can extend the default shutdown time out until the end of the day. Otherwise, the lab will pause after 6 hours have lapsed.

== Access Lab Components
Now that you have provisioned the environment, you must verify that you can access the lab's connections.

=== Access the OpenShift Container Platform Web Console

* link:https://docs.openshift.com/acs/3.73/architecture/acs-architecture.html#centralized-components_acs-architecture[**Central**^]: [Centralized component] Central is the main component of RHACS and it is installed as a Kubernetes deployment.
It handles data persistence, API interactions, and user interface (portal) access.
You can use the same Central instance to secure multiple OpenShift Container Platform or Kubernetes clusters.

* link:https://docs.openshift.com/acs/3.73/architecture/acs-architecture.html#centralized-components_acs-architecture[**Scanner**^]: [Centralized component] RHACS includes an image vulnerability scanning component called Scanner.
It analyzes the image layers to check for known vulnerabilities from the Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVEs) list.
Scanner also identifies vulnerabilities in packages installed by package managers and in dependencies for multiple programming languages.

* link:https://docs.openshift.com/acs/3.73/architecture/acs-architecture.html#per-cluster-components_acs-architecture[**Sensor**^]: [1 per cluster] RHACS uses the Sensor component to monitor Kubernetes and OpenShift Container Platform clusters.
It handles interactions with the OpenShift Container Platform or Kubernetes API server for policy detection and enforcement, and it coordinates with Collector.

* link:https://docs.openshift.com/acs/3.73/architecture/acs-architecture.html#per-cluster-components_acs-architecture[**Admission controller**^]: [1 per cluster] The admission controller prevents users from creating workloads that violate security policies in RHACS.
[1 x Admission Controller]

* link:https://docs.openshift.com/acs/3.73/architecture/acs-architecture.html#per-node-components_acs-architecture[**Collector**^]: [1 per node] Collector collects and monitors information about container runtime and network activity.
It then sends the collected information to Sensor.
